# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

This graph algorithm visualizer is implemented in **p5.js**, where you can visualize how different algorithms traverse through a maze differently. 
This project is for educational purposes, and the goal is for this tool to be used by students alongside studying graph algorithms in school.
